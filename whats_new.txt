3.12.0 - cap in nb of predictors based on correl - max 50/100 to make the process faster. Check times added in session manager. Api communication module fixed.
3.11.1 - api communication added for posting models.csv and predictions. requirements.txt updated
3.10.1 - bug fix in standard training flow - t1, t2, t3 dfs were without saved columns for predictions per models
3.10.0 - new argument added - specify max nb of features for the tree models
3.9.0 - grid search for modelling - new file that you can run load and after train session for misc combinations of params
3.8.0 - prediction flow added. .prepare() moved to main.py to avoid duplicated preparations. start_logging as well.
3.7.4 - hardcoded values removed
3.7.3 - bug in additional files merging - date with object merging in dev_ardi
3.7.2 - updated requirements
3.7.1 - missing added uint8, period[T], period[M]
3.7.0 - checking if 50GB ram is available at the start, many in undersampling logical bugs fixed.
3.6.0 - multiprocess - merging now in loop for different periods - dev process
3.5.0 - first multiprocess created
3.4.2 - opt bin is run only if specified in params to speedup the process. Removed columns during missing treatment are removed from final features before saving them.
3.4.1 - zscore in outlies is now absolute value in terms of threshold
3.4.0 - treating outliers added in data load prep flow.
3.3.3 - opt binning is again with multiproc. THe issue is - now there are much more columns and opt bin is running slowly. small print cleans done. Dev data prepr flow created for faster runs on development.
3.3.2 - opt binning is no multiprocessing due to performance issues
3.3.1 - opt binning is now with multiproc. ZAEBI!!!!
3.3.0 - opotimal binning recoded as class and now with 5 paralelized workers - multiporcess pool map. Date features added. Training modelling also multiprocess
3.2.0 - updated gitignore
3.1.0 - refactoring. functions split in separated files for easier code editing
3.0.0 - refactoring. brain new structure with objects.
2.0.0 - refactoring. Definitions.py added.
1.3.0 - docs updated - missing treatment
1.2.0 - requirements updated
1.1.0 - main.py and dataload - 2 classes created - session (all session details), loader - 2 dataframes. Requirements updated
1.0.0 - initial stable version
